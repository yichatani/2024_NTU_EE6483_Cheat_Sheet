__You can find the original PDF file here: [Cheatsheet](./2024_NTU_EE6483_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).__ It is expected that there will be further updates. 

It was inspired by this [2023_NTU_EE7401_Cheat_Sheet](https://github.com/JiangpengLI86/2023_NTU_EE7401_Cheat_Sheet).

This cheat sheet is valid only when EE6483's exam is Restricted Open Book.

The cheat sheet may have some mistakes, so check carefully when you use it. I apreciate it if you find some errors and edit and commit them in [main.tex](./main.tex).
